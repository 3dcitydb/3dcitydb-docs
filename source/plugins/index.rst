Importer/Exporter plugins
=========================

The Importer/Exporter offers a plugin mechanism that supports the
modular development and deployment of additional functionalities for
interacting with the 3D City Database or external datasets. For
instance, plugins may enable loading or extracting 3D city model content
using data formats other than CityGML, CityJSON or KML/COLLADA/glTF.
