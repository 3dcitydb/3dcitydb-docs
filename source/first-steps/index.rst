First steps
===========

The 3D City Database (3DCityDB) is a free and open source package consisting
of a database schema and a set of software tools to import, manage, analyse,
visualize, and export virtual 3D city models on top of a spatial database system.

This quickstart guide gives step-by-step instructions for setting up
a 3D City Database instance. Installers for the 3D City Database scripts and tools
can be downloaded from the official project website at http://www.3dcitydb.org.
The source code of the 3D City Database is hosted and maintained on GitHub
at https://github.com/3dcitydb.

The individual components of the 3D City Database are also available as
images for the Docker virtualization technology. This makes it possible
to install and configure a 3D City Database with a single command line
statement in almost any runtime environment.
