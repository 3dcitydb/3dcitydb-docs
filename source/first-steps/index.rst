First steps
===========

This quickstart guide gives step-by-step instructions for setting up
a 3D City Database instance and installing the Importer/Exporter.
Installers for the 3D City Database components can be downloaded from
the `official release website <https://github.com/3dcitydb/3dcitydb-suite/releases>`_
or from the project website at https://www.3dcitydb.org. The source code of
the 3D City Database is hosted and maintained on GitHub at https://github.com/3dcitydb.

The individual components of the 3D City Database are also available as
images for the Docker virtualization technology. This makes it possible
to install and configure a 3D City Database with a single command line
statement in almost any runtime environment.
