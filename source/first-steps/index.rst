First steps
===========

The 3D City Database comes with scripts for setting up an instance
of the relational schema on PostgreSQL/PostGIS or Oracle
Spatial/Locator, and with a Importer/Exporter tool for loading and
exporting your 3D city model data. Installers for the 3D City Database are available
from http://www.3dcitydb.org. The source code of the 3D City
Database project is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/3dcitydb. Please follow
the instructions in the next chapters to set up a 3D City Database instance.

The individual components of the 3D City Database are also available as
images for the Docker virtualization technology. This makes it possible
to install and configure a 3D City Database with a single command line
statement in almost any runtime environment.
