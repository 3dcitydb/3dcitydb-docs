-------------------

With the feature types filter, you can restrict the import to one or more
features types by enabling the corresponding checkboxes. Only features of the
selected type(s) will be imported.

   Feature type filter for import operations.

The feature type filter only shows top-level feature types. It will automatically
contain feature types from CityGML ADEs if a corresponding ADE extension has been correctly
registered with the Importer/Exporter (see :numref:`impexp_plugin_ade_manager_chapter`).
