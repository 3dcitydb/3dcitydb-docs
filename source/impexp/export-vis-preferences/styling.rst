Styling
^^^^^^^

The *Styling* preferences allow you to define colors and symbols to be used for
the visualization of the exported city objects.
Styles can be defined for each top-level feature type separately on
different subnodes of the *Styling* preference node. If an ADE extension
is registered with the Importer/Exporter that supports exporting
ADE features for visualization, additional subnodes for each
ADE top-level feature type are automatically added and available.

Styling of surface and solid geometries
---------------------------------------

The styling options for surface and solid geometries of city objects
are explained in the following using the preferences dialog of the
*Building* feature type as shown below. This dialog offers the most
settings of all feature types. The only exceptions are the dialogs for
*GenericCityObject* and ADE top-level feature types, which provide
additional styling options for point and curve geometries
(see :numref:`impexp_vis_export_preferences_styling_point_curve`).

   Visualization export preferences â€“ Styling options.

The dialog lets you define different styles for the different *display forms*
offered by the visualization export (see :numref:`impexp_kml_export_chapter`).
The styling options are therefore grouped
into *Footprint and Extruded* [1], *Geometry* [2], and *COLLADA/glTF* [3].

**Default style and highlight style**

All styling options for the different display forms have in common that
you can specify a *default style* and an optional *highlight style*. For
feature types that can be modelled with roof surfaces such as buildings,
bridges and tunnels an additional *roof style* is available for the *Geometry*
and *COLLADA/glTF* display forms.

A style consists of a *fill color* and an *outline color*
that are used for rendering the surfaces of a corresponding city object.
Only in case of the *COLLADA/glTF* display form, outline colors are not
supported for the default and roof styles.
To choose a color, simply click on the button for the fill or outline
color. This brings up a default color selection dialog where you can either pick
a color from a palette or enter a HSV, HSL, RGB or CMYK color code. Note that
you can also define an alpha/transparency value for your color. After
accepting the selected color, it is also used as new color for the button
in the dialog. This way, you have an immediate visual feedback of the
color that will be applied in the visualization export.

Both the default style and the roof style are immediately applied
when a city object is loaded and becomes visible in the viewer.
The highlight style, however, is only shown when hovering the mouse over a city object.
This highlighting effect is realized by duplicating all surfaces
of the feature and assigning the chosen highlight
color to these duplicates. The resulting "highlight geometry" is stored as additional
KML geometry for each feature and is loaded together with the feature but set
to invisible by default.

For the display forms *Geometry* and *COLLADA/glTF*,
an additional *Surface distance* value between 0 and 10 meters (default: 0.75)
can be defined to make sure that the original surfaces and their duplicates
are not coincident. The highlight surface is moved along the direction
if its face normal by the provided distance value. This way, the highlight
geometry realizes an "exploded" view of the city object, which helps to avoid
Z-fighting effects.

   :name: pic_kml_collada_gltf_preferences_rendering_collada
   :align: center

   Example of the highlight style in Google Earth.

.. note::
  Since the highlight geometry duplicates the original feature geometry,
  it has a significant impact on loading times and may also impair the general
  visualization performance.

.. note::
  The highlight style has been mainly developed for use with Google Earth and directly
  works with this viewer. The 3D web map client shipped with the 3D City Database (see :numref:`webmap_chapter`)
  does **not support the highlight geometry** but uses Cesium functionalities
  for object highlighting. If you intend to use the export
  with the 3D web map client only, disable the highlight geometry.

**Footprint and Extruded styling options**

In addition to the definitions of colors for the different styles, the
*Footprint and Extruded* settings let you choose the LoD0 geometry
that shall be used for rendering buildings when LoD0 is used as target
LoD for the visualization export on the *VIS Export* tab. Note that
this selection is only available for the *Building* feature type but
not for other feature types. The following options are available for the LoD0 geometry:

-  **Footprint**: The footprint geometry of buildings will be used for visualization.
-  **Roofprint**: The roofprint geometry of buildings will be used for visualization.
-  **Roofprint - use footprint as fallback**: Roofprint geometries will be
   used in the first place. If no roofprint geometry is available, the footprint geometry
   is used as fallback.

**Geometry styling options**

As mentioned above, an additional *roof style* can be defined for the *Geometry*
display form if the corresponding feature type supports roof surfaces (i.e.,
buildings, bridges, and tunnels). The *roof style* is applied to the surface geometries
of all roof surfaces modelled for the city object. The default style is used for all
other surfaces.

Especially for buildings, users often want to have roofs painted in a different
color than walls even if roof surfaces are not explicitly modelled for the building.
For this reason, the export process uses simple heuristics to identify roofs purely
based on the geometry of the building: surfaces touching the ground (i.e., having the
lowest height values) are considered to be walls and receive the *default style*.
All other surfaces are classified as roofs and receive the *roof style*.

.. note::
  The automatic detection of roof surfaces is only applied to buildings,
  and only if the building is to be exported in LoD1 or LoD2. Surfaces that
  are explicitly modelled as roof or wall surface in the model are, of course,
  excluded from the automatic detection.

**COLLADA/glTF styling options**

In contrast to the display forms *Extruded*, *Footprint* and *Geometry*,
a user can select an *appearance theme* for *COLLADA/glTF* exports on
the *VIS export* tab to apply appearance data stored in the 3DCityDB
to the surfaces of the exported city objects (see :numref:`impexp_kml_export_chapter`).
Appearance data not only comprises textures but also colors. Thus,
textures and colors assigned to a surface through the selected
appearance theme **always take precedence** over the styles defined for the
*COLLADA/glTF* display form on this preferences dialog.

As mentioned above, outline colors cannot be defined for the *default style*
and the *roof style* because they are not supported by the COLLADA and
glTF formats. Similar to the *Geometry styling options*, the *roof style*
is only available for feature types that support roof surfaces, and an
automatic roof detection is applied to buildings in accordance with the rules
discussed above.

.. _impexp_vis_export_preferences_styling_point_curve:

Styling of point and curve geometries
-------------------------------------

*GenericCityObject* features can also be modelled and stored with
point and curve geometries in addition to a surface-based representation.
Point and curve geometries can be exported in KML format by the
visualization export operation. Thus, they are supported by the
KML-based display forms *Footprint*, *Extruded* and *Geometry* but
not when exporting to *COLLADA/glTF*.

The styling preferences for the *GenericCityObject* feature type therefore
not only provide a dialog for surface and solid geometries as described
above, but also for point and curve geometries as shown below.

   :align: center

   Styling options for point and curve geometries of *GenericCityObject* features.

.. note::
  Similar to the GenericCityObject feature type, also the preferences
  for ADE top-level feature types offer styling options for surface and
  solid geometries and for point and curve geometries.

**Point styling options**

Point geometries are visualized by rendering a symbol at the
point location. You can choose between a *cross*, an *icon* and a *cube*
symbol as visual representation of the point geometry [1]. For each
symbol, a separate *default style* and optional *highlight* style can
be defined.

The *Altitude Mode* parameter specifies how the height values (altitude)
of the exported point geometries are to be interpreted by a
viewer or application.

.. list-table::  *Supported altitude modes for point geometries*
   :align: center
   :name: export_vis_styling_points_altitude_mode
   :widths: 20 70

   * - | **Altitude mode**
     - | **Description**
   * - | **relative**
     - | The altitude is interpreted as a value in meters above the terrain. The absolute height value can be determined by adding the terrain elevation.
   * - | **absolute**
     - | The altitude is interpreted as an absolute height value in meters according to the vertical reference system (EGM96 geoid in Google Earth, WGS84 ellipsoid in Cesium).
   * - | **clamp to ground**
     - | The altitude will be ignored and the point geometry will always be clamped to the ground.

The three different symbol types offer the following additional
settings.

**Cross**
  When choosing the *cross* symbol, the point geometry is visualized
  as crosshair with a length of approx. 2 meters. This length
  value cannot be customized. However, you can pick an additional
  line width for both the default and the highlight style.

.. figure:: /media/impexp_kml_export_example_cross_fig.png
   :name: pic_kml_collada_gltf_preferences_cross
   :align: center

   A point geometry displayed as cross symbol.

**Icon**
  The *icon* symbol uses a KML ``<Placemark>`` element with the point
  geometry and displays an icon at this position. Besides the color of
  the icon, also its size can be defined for both the default and the highlight style
  using the *Scale* parameter, where the default value 1 means no scaling.

.. figure:: /media/impexp_kml_export_example_icon_fig.png
   :name: pic_kml_collada_gltf_preferences_point
   :align: center

   An point geometry displayed as icon symbol.

**Cube**
  The third symbol for representing a point geometry is *cube*.
  In this case, a small cube is rendered at the point location. You can
  define the the side length for the cube for the default style, which
  will also be applied to the highlight style. In addition, you can
  define the *Line width* of the cube's outline for the highlight
  style (a value of 1.0 is used for the default style).

.. figure:: /media/impexp_kml_export_example_cube_fig.png
   :name: pic_kml_collada_gltf_preferences_cube
   :align: center

   A point geometry displayed as cube symbol.

**Curve styling options**

The styling options for curve geometries [2] are similar to those
for the *cross* symbol of point geometries. And like with point
geometries, you can also define a separate *Altitude mode* for
curve geometries. The values and their meanings are identical
to those described above in :numref:`export_vis_styling_points_altitude_mode`.

.. note::
   When displaying curve geometries in Google Earth, the
   altitude modes *absolute* and *relative* may result in curves
   intersecting with or hovering over the terrain. Please choose
   *clamp to ground* if you want the curve geometries
   to be draped on the terrain instead.

The following figure exemplifies the visualization of point and
curve geometries in Google Earth. It shows an indoor routing network
for a building on the campus of the Technical University Munich (TUM).
The nodes and edges of this network are modelled as GenericCityObject
features with 3D point and curve geometries. The nodes are displayed
using the *cube* symbol.
