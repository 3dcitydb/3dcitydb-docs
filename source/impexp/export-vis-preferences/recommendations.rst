Recommendations
===============

This chapter provides general recommendations and best practices
for using the visualization export operation of the Importer/Exporter
and for loading exports with Google Earth and Cesium.

General settings
----------------

Depending on the quality and complexity of 3D city model content stored in the 3DCityDB,
export results may greatly very in visual quality and loading performance.
Experimenting will be required in most cases for a fine-tuning of the
export parameters. However, some general rules apply for almost all cases:

-     Using KMZ as output format is recommended when the files will be accessed over a
      network and the selected display form is either *Footprint*, *Extruded*,
      or *Geometry.* When exporting glTF models, writing KMZ files is not supported though.

-     Visibility values for the different display forms should be increased
      in steps of around one third of the tile side length.

-     Setting *visible from* to 0 pixels (always visible) should be avoided,
      especially for large or complex exports, because otherwise the
      viewer will immediately load all data as it must be visible at once.

-     Be careful that tile files do not become too large, otherwise the
      viewer may become unresponsive. You can influence the tile file size
      by changing the side length of tiles (whether tiling is *automatic* or *manual*).
      Tests with Google Earth showed that files should be smaller than 10MB.
      To meet this limit for crowded areas with many city objects, a tile side length
      between 50 and 100m seemed to be usable.

-     When not exporting in the *COLLADA/glTF* display form, files will
      seldomly reach this 10MB limit, but viewers might still become
      unresponsive if the file loaded contains a lot of polygons, so do
      not use too large tiles for *Footprint*, *Extruded* and *Geometry*
      exports even if the resulting files are comparatively small.

-     Do not choose too small tile sizes, many of them may become visible
      at the same time and render the tiling advantage useless.

-     Using texture atlas generation when producing *COLLADA/glTF* display
      form exports always results in faster loading times.

-     From these algorithms, *BASIC* is the fastest (shortest generation time)
      and produces good results, whereas *TPIM* is the most efficient (highest
      ratio of used area of the total atlas size) but also the slowest.

-     Texture images can often be scaled down to 0.2 - 0.5 without
      noticeable quality loss. This depends, of course, on the quality
      of the original textures.

-     Using a highlight style puts the same polygons twice in the resulting export
      files, one for the features themselves, one for their
      highlight geometry. This has a negative impact on the viewing
      performance. The more complex the city objects are, the worse the
      impact. When highlighting is enabled for exports based on model in
      LoD3 or higher, especially Google Earth may become quite slow.

-     If you want to use the 3DCityDB web map client to visualize the
      exported datasets, a highlight style should not be used
      since object highlighting is supported by the web map client
      in another way without the need for extra highlight geometries.

-     The 3DCityDB web map client allows for on-the-fly activating and
      deactivating shadow visualization for 3D objects exported in the glTF
      format. However, this functionality is currently not available when
      viewing KML models exported in the *Footprint*, *Extruded*, and
      *Geometry* display forms.

-     Balloon generation is slightly more efficient when a single template
      file is applied for all exported objects.

-     When exporting in the *Footprint* or *Extruded* display forms, the
      *altitude mode* settings will be silently ignored but an appropriate value
      will be automatically chosen to ensure that the exported objects
      will be properly placed on the terrain.
      However, when exporting in the *Geometry* or *COLLADA/glTF* display
      forms, the *altitude mode* settings must be deliberately chosen
      with regard to the viewer to be used.

-     In most cases, the combination of the *relative* altitude mode with
      the *Move every object on the globe (zero elevation)* option for height offsets allows
      for properly placing objects on the terrain. However, when using the Cesium-based
      3DCityDB web map client, its default WGS84 ellipsoid terrain model
      must be activated.

-     When your city objects are stored with absolute height values in the
      database and you intend to use Google Earth as viewer, you should
      consider to use the following options (given that you own an API key
      for the Google Elevation service): 1) *absolute* altitude mode,
      2) use the *generic attribute GE_LoDn_zOffset* for height offset,
      and 3) *query the Google Eleveation API".

Loading exports in Google Earth and Cesium
------------------------------------------

In order to make full use of the features and functionalities provided
by Google Earth, it is highly recommended to use the enhanced version of
Google Earth â€“ **Google Earth Pro** which is available free of charge
starting from January 2015. Some of the features described in this
documentation, like highlighting, can also flawlessly work in the normal
Google Earth with version 6.0.1 or higher.

Displaying a file in Google Earth can be achieved by opening it through
the menu ("*File*", "*Open*") or double-clicking on any KML or KMZ file
if these extensions are associated with the program (default option at
Google Earth's installation time).

Loaded files can be refreshed when generated again after loading (if for
example the balloon template file was changed) by choosing the
"*Revert*" option in the context menu on the sidebar. There is no need
to delete and load them again or shutdown or restart the Earth browser.

For best performance, cache options ("*Tools*", "*Options*", "*Cache*")
should be set to their maximum values, 1024 MB for memory cache size,
2000 MB for disk cache. Actual maximums may be lower depending on the
computer's hardware.

Google Earth enables showing the terrain layer by default for realistic
display of 3D models. Disabling of terrain layer is only possible in
Google Earth Pro. You may need to disable the terrain layer in case that
the exported models cannot be seen although shown as loaded in Google
Earth's sidebar, since they are probably buried into the ground (see
:numref:`impexp_kml_export_terrain_preferences_chapter`).

When exporting balloons into individual files (one for each object)
written together into a *balloons* directory access to local files and
personal data must be allowed ("*Tools*", "*Options*", "*General*").
Google Earth will issue a security warning that must be accepted,
otherwise the contents of the balloons (when in individual files and not
as a part of the doc.kml file) will not be displayed.

It is also possible to upload the generated KML/COLLADA/glTF files to a
web server and access them from there via internet browser with Cesium
Virtual Globe (starting from December 2015, the Google Earth Plugin is
no longer supported by most modern web browsers due to security
considerations). In this case, the Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
shall be enabled on the web server to allow cross-domain AJAX requests
sent from the based-web frontend.

.. note::
   Starting with version 7 (and at least up to version 7.1.1.1888)
   Google Earth has changed the way transparent or semi-transparent
   surfaces are rendered. This is especially relevant for visualizations
   containing highlighting surfaces (explained in
   :numref:`impexp_kml_export_rendering_preferences_chapter`). When
   viewing KML/COLLADA models in Google Earth it is strongly recommended to
   use Google Earth (Pro) version 7 or higher and switch to the OpenGL
   graphic mode for an optimal viewing experience. Changing the Graphic
   Mode can be achieved by clicking on *Tools*, *Options* entry, *3D View*
   Tab.
