   Import preferences â€“ Resources.

**Multithreading settings**

The software architecture of the
Importer/Exporter is based on multithreading. Put simply, the different
tasks of an import process are carried out by separate threads. The
decoupling of compute bound from I/O bound tasks and their parallel
non-blocking processing usually leads to an increase of the overall
application performance. For example, threads waiting for database
response do not block threads parsing the input document or processing
the CityGML/CityJSON input features. In a multi-core environment, threads can
even be executed simultaneously on multiple CPUs or cores.

The *Resource* settings allow for controlling the minimum and maximum
number of concurrent threads during import [1]. Make sure to enter
reasonable values depending on your hardware configuration. By default,
the maximum number is set to the number of available CPUs/cores times
two.

.. caution::
   A higher number of threads *does not necessarily result in a
   better performance*. In contrast, a too high number of active threads
   faces disadvantages such as thread life-cycle overhead and resource
   thrashing. Also note that each thread requires its *own physical
   connection to the database*. Therefore, your database must be ready to
   handle enough parallel physical connections. Ask you database
   administrator for assistance.

**Batch processing**

In order to optimize database response times,
multiple database statements are submitted to the database in a single
request (*batch processing*). This allows for an efficient data
processing on the database side. The user can influence the number of
SQL statements in one batch through the settings dialog [2]. The dialog
differentiates between batch sizes for top-level features (default: 20)
and cache entries for object identifiers and temporary XLink information
(default: 1000 each).

.. note::
   All database operations within one batch are buffered in main
   memory before being submitted to the database. Thus, the
   Importer/Exporter might run out of memory if the batch size is too high
   (see :numref:`impexp_launching_chapter` for how to increase the available
   main memory). After a batch is submitted, the transaction is committed.

**Cache settings**

The Importer/Exporter employs strategies for parsing
CityGML datasets of arbitrary file size and for resolving XLink
references. A naive approach for XLink resolving would read the entire
CityGML dataset into main memory. However, CityGML datasets quickly
become too big to fit into main memory. For this reason, the import
process follows a two-phase strategy:

In a first run, features are
written to the database neglecting references to remote objects. If a
feature contains an XLink though, any context information about the
XLink is written to temporary database tables. This information
comprises, for instance, the table name and primary key of the
referencing feature/geometry instance as well as the identifier (gml:id) of the
target object. In addition, while parsing the document, the import process keeps track
of every encountered gml:id as well as the table name and primary key of
the corresponding object in database. It is important to record this
information because it cannot be predicted a priori whether or not a
gml:id is referenced by an XLink from somewhere else in the document. In
order to ensure fast access, the information is cached in memory. If the
maximum cache size is reached, the cache is drained to temporary database
tables to prevent memory overflows.

In a second run, the temporary tables containing the context information
about XLinks are revisited and
queried. Since the entire CityGML document has been processed at this
point in time, valid references can be resolved and processed
accordingly. With the help of the object identifier cache, the referenced objects
can be quickly identified within the database.

The caching and paging behaviour for object identifiers can be influenced via
the *Resource* preferences [3]. The dialog lets a user enter the maximum
number of identifiers to be held in main memory (default: 200,000
*entries*), the percentage of entries that will be written to the
database if the cache limit is reached (*page factor*, default: 85%), as
well as the number of parallel temporary tables used for paging (*table
partitions*, default: 10). The Importer/Exporter uses separate
caches for identifiers of geometries and features [3]. Moreover, a
third cache is used for handling texture atlases and offers similar
settings [4].

.. note::
  By default, the temporary tables for draining the caches are created
  in the same 3D City Database instance. You can also choose
  to use a local cache instead (see :numref:`impexp_general_preferences_cache` for more details).
  However, note that some temporary information must be stored in the
  database even if you use a local cache to be able to perform JOINs between
  temporary tables and tables of the 3DCityDB schema.
