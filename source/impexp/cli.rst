Using the command line interface (CLI)
--------------------------------------

In addition to the graphical user interface, the Importer/Exporter also
offers a command line interface (CLI). The CLI allows a user to run the
Importer/Exporter from the command line (or a shell script) and to
easily embed it in batch processing workflows and third-party
applications.

To use the CLI, you first need to start a shell environment offered by
the operating system of your choice. The general command to run the
Importer/Exporter from a shell environment (or a shell script) is shown
below. Please replace the ``{version}`` token in the file name
with your current version.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ java -jar lib/impexp-client-{version}.jar [-options]

This command consists of two parts. The first part executes the Java
Virtual Machine (JVM) through the ``java`` command. The ``-jar`` argument of
the JVM is used to denote the path to the Importer/Exporter JAR file
``impexp-client-{version}.jar`` to be executed. After the JAR filename, you can
provide additional program arguments to trigger a specific operation of
the Importer/Exporter.

.. note::
   The above command assumes that you first change the directory
   to the installation directory of the Importer/Exporter. Otherwise,
   you must provide the full path to the ``impexp-client-{version}.jar`` file,
   or include it in your ``PATH`` environment variable.

You may add any further JVM arguments to the above command that you
think are required in your environment. *It is recommended* to at least
start the JVM with a *minimum amount of main memory* using the ``-Xms``
argument. For instance, use ``java -Xms1G`` to allocate 1 GB of your main memory
for the Importer/Exporter at startup.

To get a list of program arguments offered by the Importer/Exporter, use
the ``-help`` option:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ java -jar lib/impexp-client-{version}.jar -help

This will produce an output like shown below.

The available program arguments are:

.. list-table:: Command line arguments of the Importer/Exporter.
   :name: impexp_cli_help_arguments_table

   * - | **Argument**
     - | **Description**
   * - | ``-shell``
     - | This argument is mandatory to start the shell version of the Importer/Exporter.
       | If this argument is not provided, then the GUI version is launched by default.
   * - | ``-config``
     - | Provides the path and filename of the config file to be used. If this argument
       | is omitted, the config file in the default path is used instead. Using environment
       | variables, the default path can be identified dynamically
       | (cf. :numref:`impexp_launching_chapter`):

       - ``%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\3dcitydb\importer-exporter\config``
         (Windows 7 and higher)
       - ``$HOME/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/config``
         (UNIX/Linux, Mac OS families)

   * - | ``-import``
     - | Triggers a CityGML import process. Provide a list of one or more input files
       | separated by semicolons (;) in addition. The list may also contain folders. A folder
       | and all its nested subfolders are recursively scanned for CityGML input files.
   * - | ``-validate``
     - | Triggers a XML Schema validation on the provided list of input files
       | (see the *import* argument).
   * - | ``-export``
     - | Triggers a CityGML export process. Provide the path and name of the output file.
   * - | ``-kmlExport``
     - | Triggers a KML/COLLADA/glTF export process. Provide the path and name of the
       | output file.
   * - | ``-delete``
     - | Deletes data from the database according to the settings in the config file.
   * - | ``-testConnection``
     - | Connects to the database using the connection details provided in the config file
       | and exits afterwards. Evaluate the exit code (and optionally the log messages on
       | the console) to check whether the connection was established successfully.
   * - | ``-pid-file``
     - | Creates a file containing the process identifier (PID) of the Importer/Exporter
       | process. Provide the path and name of the PID file.

The full range of preferences and settings affecting the different
operations of the Importer/Exporter **are not
offered** as separate program arguments. Instead, it is assumed that the
config file (either the default one or the one provided through the
``-config`` argument) contains all the settings that should be used in a
specific operation (e.g., the database connection details, filter
settings for imports and exports, etc.). The config file is encoded as
XML and hence can be edited by a user manually. However, a simple way
to obtain a valid config file is as follows:

1. Run the Importer/Exporter with the graphical user interface (GUI).
2. Make all your settings in the GUI.
3. Save your settings to a local config file via the *Project Save
   Project Asâ€¦* dialog from the main menu bar.
4. Make manual changes to the config file if required.
5. Feed this config file to the command line interface using the ``-config``
   argument.

.. note::
   You can also create a config file programmatically in Java. The
   JAR file *impexp-config-{version}}.jar* in the installation directory of the
   Importer/Exporter contains all the classes required for reading and
   writing a config file. Once you have the JAR file on your classpath, use
   the class `org.citydb.config.ConfigUtil` as starting point.
