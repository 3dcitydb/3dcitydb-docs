   Export preferences – XML Namespaces.

By clicking the ``+`` and ``-`` buttons, more than one XML namespace can be configured for the exporter. The target
namespace, its location, as well as its prefix can either be selected from a dropdown list containing the default values, or
explicitly declared in the corresponding input fields. Each namespace declaration can also be skipped or forcibly applied
by clicking on the ``↷`` or ``!``.
