CityObjectGroup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When exporting city object groups, also group members are written to the
target CityGML dataset (cf. :numref:`impexp_citygml_export_chapter`).
Group members are always given
*by reference* (i.e., the *grp:member* property uses an *xlink:href*
reference to point to the group member in the dataset) and only group
members satisfying the filter settings are export.

   Export preferences â€“ CityObjectGroup.

The default behavior can be changed using this preference dialog. When
checking the option *Export all group members as xlink:href references*,
then an *xlink:href* reference is created for each group member defined
in the database, no matter whether this group member is also exported or
skipped due to filter settings. Thus, the consistency of the
*xlink:href* references is not checked, and some references might not be
resolvable in the final dataset. The benefit of skipping this check is
that the performance of the CityGML export is increased.
