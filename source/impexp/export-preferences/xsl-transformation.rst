XSL Transformation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
  These preference settings only apply to CityGML exports.

Like with CityGML imports, you can apply XSL transformations
during the export process to change the resulting CityGML output data.
Simply check the *Apply XSLT stylesheets* option and point to an XSLT
stylesheet in your local file system using the *Browse* button. The
stylesheet will be automatically considered by the export process to
transform the CityGML data before it is written to a file.

   Export preferences â€“ XSL transformation.

By clicking the ``+`` and ``-`` buttons, more than one XSLT stylesheet can be
provided to the exporter. The stylesheets are applied in the given order,
with the output of a stylesheet being the input for its direct
successor. The Importer/Exporter is shipped with example XSLT
stylesheets in the folder ``templates/XSLTransformations`` of the
installation directory.

.. note::
   - To be able to handle arbitrarily large exports, the export
     process reads single top-level features from the database, which are
     then written to the target file. Thus, each XSLT stylesheet will just
     work on individual top-level features but not on the entire file.
   - The output of each XSLT stylesheet must again be a valid CityGML
     structure.
   - Only stylesheets written in the XSLT language version 1.0 are
     supported.
