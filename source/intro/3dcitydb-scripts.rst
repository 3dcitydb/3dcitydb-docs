3D City Database SQL Scripts
----------------------------

The required scripts for setting up the 3D City Database are in the
installation directory of the Importer/Exporter within the
*3dcitydb/oracle/* or *3dcitydb/postgresql/* subfolders.

Shell Scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In previous versions of the 3D City Database the setup was managed
through user prompts in SQL scripts. To facilitate continuous
integration workflows these inputs have been moved to batch (Windows)
and shell scripts (UNIX/Linux/macOS). The following table provides an
overview of the different shell scripts:

The batch/shell scripts can be executed on double click. On some
UNIX/Linux distributions though, you will have to run the .sh scripts
from within a shell environment. Please open your favorite shell and
check whether execution permission is set for the starter script. Change
to the installation folder and enter the following to make the starter
script executable for the owner of the file, e.g.:

.. code:: bash
   
   chmod u+x CREATE_DB.sh

Afterwards, simply run the shell script by typing:

.. code:: bash
   
   ./CREATE_DB.sh

.. note::
   The **database connection details need to be set** in the
   CONNECTION_DETAILS script prior to executing the batch/shell scripts.

SQL Scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~

The SQLScripts directory contains four subfolders:

**SCHEMA**

Includes SQL files about the logical (tables, constraints) and physical
(datatypes, indexes) database schema of the 3D City Database exported
from the schema modelling tools `JDeveloper <https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/jdev/overview/index.html>`_ (Oracle) or `pgModeler <https://pgmodeler.io/>`_ (PostgreSQL) (with
minor changes). INSERT statements for the prefilled lookup tables
`OBJECTCLASS` and `AGGREGATION_INFO` as well as converter functions
between table names and objectclass IDs can be found in the OBJECTCLASS
subfolder. Because of PostgreSQLâ€™s way to handle database schemas the
SCHEMA folder contains a few more scripts with stored procedures. See
chapter :doc:`Working with multiple database schemas <../3dcitydb/multi-schema>`
for more details.

**CITYDB_PKG**

Contains scripts that create database objects and stored procedures
mainly to be used by the Importer/Exporter application. They are written
in PL/SQL (Oracle) or PL/pgSQL (PostgreSQL) and grouped by the type of
operation (data manipulation, maintenance etc.). The APIs are introduced
in :doc:`Stored Procedures <../3dcitydb/sproc/index>` chapter.

**UTIL**

This folder assembles different database management utilities:

-  :doc:`Grant and revoke read rights <../3dcitydb/multi-schema#read-and-write-access-to-a-schema>`
   to and from the 3D City Database.

-  :doc:`Create <../3dcitydb/multi-schema#create-and-address-database-schemas>`
   additional database schemas with a 3D City Database layout
   (PostgreSQL-only)

-  Enable or disable versioning (execution can be time-consuming)
   (Oracle-only)

-  Update table statistics for spatial columns (PostgreSQL-only)

**MIGRATION**

Provides a migration path from previous releases to the newest version.
See :doc:`Upgrade <upgrade>` chapter for more details. This folder will
also include upgrade scripts for upcoming minor releases.
