System requirements
-------------------

Since the 3D web client utilizes the WebGL-based Cesium Virtual Globe as
its 3D geo-visualization engine, the hardware on which the 3D web client
will be run must have a graphics card installed that supports WebGL. In
addition, the web browser in use must also provide appropriate WebGL
support. You can visit the following website to check whether your web
browser supports WebGL or not:

.. code-block::

    http://get.webgl.org/

The 3DCityDB-Web-Map-Client has been successfully tested on (but is not
limited to) the following web browsers under different desktop operating
systems like Microsoft Windows, Linux, Apple Mac OS X, and even on
mobile operating systems like Android and iOS.

-  Apple Safari

-  Mozilla Firefox

-  Google Chrome

-  Opera

For best viewing and interaction performance, it is recommended to use
**Google Chrome**.


Using the 3D Web Client from the 3DCityDB homepage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to try the 3DCityDB-Web-Map-Client or do not have a
possibility to install it on your own web server, you can use the
pre-installed version from the 3DCityDB homepage under the URL

.. code-block::

    https://www.3dcitydb.org/3dcitydb-web-map/1.9.0/3dwebclient/index.html

This is a stable link and can be used for long-time working demo links.
If new versions will be released in the future, the old versions remain
functional on the server and the new versions will be installed in new
subfolders (i.e. next to the folder ‘1.9.0’).
