Using the WFS
-------------

The Web Feature Service is implemented against version 2.0 of the OGC
Web Feature Service Interface Standard. Previous versions are not
supported any more, and clients must make sure to use this version of
the interface when sending requests to the WFS service.

The following chapters provide a documentation of the functionality
offered by the 3D City Database Web Feature Service. They *do not
provide* a general overview or description of the OGC Web Feature
Service Interface Standard itself. If you need more general information
about WFS, please refer to the WFS specification document instead (OGC
Doc. No. 09-025r2).
