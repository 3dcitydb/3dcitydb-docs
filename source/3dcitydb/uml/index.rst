UML class diagram
-----------------

The following pages cite several parts of the CityGML specification
[GKNH2012]_ which are necessary for a better understanding.
Main focus is put on explaining the customization and the differences to
the CityGML standard.

Design decisions in the model are explicitly visualised within the UML
diagrams. Following models are presented in detail:


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   geometry-topology
   implicit-geometry
   appearance
   thematic-model/index


For intuitive understanding, classes which will be merged to a single
table in the relational schema, are shown as orange blocks in the UML
diagrams. n:m relations, which only can be represented by additional
tables, are represented as green blocks.
